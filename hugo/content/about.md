{{< portrait width="250" height="250" alt="My Headshot" >}}

Mathematician by training, software engineer by trade.

I love learning new things, solving problems, and figuring out how stuff works.
When I'm not staring at screens, I enjoy reading about medieval history, losing games of chess, and drinking whisky that I can't afford to buy.

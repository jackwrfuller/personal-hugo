I make no secret of my passion for self-hosting.
To me, there is something so satisfying about being self-reliant and fully in control of your infrastructure.
No wonder then that my introduction to [Lagoon](https://lagoon.sh/) was such a boon.
Lagoon is like your very own self-hosted cloud platform - an AWS without the cloud bill shock[^1], a Netlify without the restriction to static websites.
However, despite being incredibly powerful Lagoon does come at a minor cost: you have to prepare applications to be run on it.
This prepatory process is called _lagoonisation_, and while not an extremely difficult one it is nonetheless more burdensome than the aforementioned platforms. 
Fortunately once you understand the process, self-hosting pretty much any container in a cloud native fashion becomes a breeze.




[^1]: Although as it turned out, I did get an electricity bill shock because running a cluster 24x7 on an old gaming PC with a 1080 GPU is, unsurprisingly, quite power hungry.
